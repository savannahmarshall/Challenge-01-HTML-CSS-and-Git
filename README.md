My motivation for this project was to improve a set of starter code provided in GitLab by adding and revising multiple components.

My goals were to include semantic elements in HTML in the proper order, create accessible alt attributes to both icons and images, ensure that heading attributes fall in sequential order and create a concise and descriptive title. In addition, all links on the page needed to be functioning correctly, CSS selectors and properties needed to be consolidated and the CSS file properly commented.

I learned how to organize code using semantic elements, add alt attributes and how to condense CSS classes. I also learned how to include clickable links in HTML.

On this page, you can click on “Search Engine Optimization, Online Reputation Management and Social Media Marketing” in the upper right hand corner to view the section of information that matches the title. You can also view the HTML and CSS code of this page by right clicking and selecting inspect. I learned that all files need to be in the same folder for the css and html to be linked on GitHub.

My original commits I made in git bash are in the 02 Challenge folder. I had to copy over my index.html code and style css because I was having issues with deployment and only my README was showing.
